Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Include the required header files:

string.h

ctype.h

stdio.h

Step 3: Initialize global variables:

k_count = 0 to count keywords.

i_count = 0 to count identifiers.

Step 4: Define the function keyword(char str[10]):

Check if the input string is a C keyword using strcmp().

If it matches, print it's a keyword and increment k_count.

Otherwise, print it's an identifier and increment i_count.

Step 5: In the main() function:

Declare file pointers f1, f2, and f3.

Declare character variables and arrays: c, str[10], str1[10].

Declare integer variables: num[100], lineno, tokenvalue, i, j, k, count, s_count.

Step 6: Open files:

input.txt in read mode (f1)

identifier in write mode (f2)

special char in write mode (f3)

Step 7: Read characters from input.txt using getc() in a loop until EOF:

If character is a digit:

Convert to number and form complete numeric token.

Store number in num[].

Increment count.

Else if character is an alphabet:

Write character to identifier file.

Continue reading alphanumeric characters, _, or $, and write to file.

Add space at the end of the word.

Else if character is space or tab, print a space.

Else if character is newline (\n), increment lineno.

Else: Write character to special char file.

Step 8: Close all three files.

Step 9: Print the list of numbers found in the program from the num[] array.

Step 10: Open identifier file in read mode.

Step 11: Read each word (separated by space) from the file:

Store characters in str until space is found.

Terminate string with \0.

Call keyword(str) to check and print whether it's a keyword or identifier.

Step 12: Close identifier file.

Step 13: Open special char file in read mode.

Step 14: Read each character and:

Print it.

Increment s_count.

Step 15: Close special char file.

Step 16: Print the final counts:

Total number of lines (lineno)

Count of numbers (count)

Total number of keywords (k_count)

Total number of identifiers (i_count)

Total number of special characters (s_count)

Step 17: End.
